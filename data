The flag MSG_OOB is used to send ``out-of-band'' data on sockets that support this notion (e.g. SOCK_STREAM); the underlying protocol must also support ``out-of-band'' data.  MSG_EOR is used to indicate a record mark for protocols which support the concept.  MSG_EOF requests that the sender side of a socket be shut down, and that an appropriate indication be sent at the end of the specified data; this flag is only implemented for SOCK_STREAM sockets in the PF_INET protocol family.  MSG_DONTROUTE is usually used only by diagnostic or routing programs.  MSG_NOSIGNAL is used to prevent SIGPIPE generation when writing a socket that may be closed.The flag MSG_OOB is used to send ``out-of-band'' data on sockets that support this notion (e.g. SOCK_STREAM); the underlying protocol must also support ``out-of-band'' data.
